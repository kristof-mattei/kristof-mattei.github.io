A while back I wrote how to change the [handedness](../2014-05-15-menu-on-the-wrong-side-with-a-touch-screen/index.md) (which seems to be the correct term, instead of the dreadful 'Menu on the wrong side with a touch screen').

I got a machine in my hands which exhibited the previously mentioned problem. However Tablet PC Settings weren't installed, so we couldn't open the tab.

After searching the bowels of the internet I found the following shell shortcut:

```
shell:::{80F3F1D5-FECA-45F3-BC32-752C152E456E}
```

Putting this in Winkey+R, or in the Windows 7/8(.1) search box will open the Tablet PC Settings, and if you don't have a touch screen, will default to the Other tab, where you can change the handedness of your menus!

Have a good one,
