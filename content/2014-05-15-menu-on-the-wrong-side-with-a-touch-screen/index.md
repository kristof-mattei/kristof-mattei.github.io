When you're reading this you probably have a touch screen.

So, I never use my touch screen. Almost never. But I did notice that by default my menus in Windows (from a menu bar, not a ribbon) appear (when possible) on the right side of the clicked menu item.

Like this:

{{ image(name="menu_left.png") }}

Goosebumps. Something is off. It took me a while to realize this,

**The menu expanded to the left!**

So, what is this. I can't remember what exactly I searched for, but the change you need to make is in **Tablet PC Settings**.

When your menus are expanded to the left you'll see something like this:

{{ image(name="right_handed.png") }}

This is different from the default that I've been used to since I've been using Windows 95.

Change it to 'Left-handed':

{{ image(name="left_handed.png") }}

Hit apply, and restart any offending programs, open a menu and enjoy:

{{ image(name="menu_right.png") }}

I can rest easy again...
